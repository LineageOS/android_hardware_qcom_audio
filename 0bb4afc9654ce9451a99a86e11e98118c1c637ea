      "message": "Is there any device that has updated blobs? As per some internal sources, this has been addressed on the blobs that come with A12 tag or with security tags and I think no msm8953 based device would have them.\n\nAlso, since 8953 HALs were split I see only FP3 using them. Hence I thought addressing this here would be a better approach. Please correct me if I am wrong.",
