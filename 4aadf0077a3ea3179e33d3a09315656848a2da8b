      "message": "\"qcom uses that on 3.18 HAL\"\nThey used it on both 3.18/4.9 until R, on R they moved thorium family to msm8974 hal. Usage of msm8916 hal and R audio blobs was producing issues as far as I remember, don\u0027t remember which, since it was quite long time ago. Why need to use msm8916 hal if qcom moved to msm8974 and it works fine?",
