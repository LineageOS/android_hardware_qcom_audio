      "message": "Hi! I really do not think this is required because libvolumelistener does not exist in stock; and I believe everything can be made to work without this blob. \nI made this change when I was experimenting with bengal bringup for Xiaomi Redmi 9T, and I believe this does not hamper functionality when this is not added.\nPlease let me know if the case is otherwise, thank you!",
