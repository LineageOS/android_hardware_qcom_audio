# List of profiles for the output device session where stream is routed.
# A stream opened with the inputs attributes which match the "flags" and
# "formats" as specified in the profile is routed to a device at
# sample rate specified under "sampling_rates" and bit width under
# "bit_width" and the topology extracted from the acdb data against
# the "app_type".
#
# the flags and formats are specified using the strings corresponding to
# enums in audio.h and audio_policy.h. They are concatenated with "|"
# without space or "\n".
# the flags and formats should match the ones in "audio_policy.conf"
